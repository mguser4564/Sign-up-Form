This was a challenging project for me in the sense that I had to learn how to do a number of things I haven't before. This included importing fonts, using "clamp()" to have elements resize depending on the width of the browser, and implementing form elements into my HTML. I also learned some about @media with css, even though it wasn't part of the assignment. I also implemented some javascript to have the tel input element adhere to a pattern and lastly, make sure the password inputs match. 

I went for a brutalist aesthetic some people may not be a fan of, but I personally like it. It's sort of cluttered, and kinda serves as a metaphor for the learning process. It can be messy when learning something for the first time. I was inspired by the underground techno 
aesthetic. Think Berlin, tumblr, viral, trashy, etc. 

Thanks for checking out my project!
